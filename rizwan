<p>Web technology refers to the tools, languages, and frameworks used to build, design, and manage websites and web applications. It includes core languages such as HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Additionally, various frameworks and libraries, like React, Angular, and Vue.js, enhance development efficiency and user experience. Web technologies also rely on protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSockets to facilitate seamless communication between clients and servers. Backend technologies, including databases and server-side scripting languages like PHP, Node.js, and Python, ensure data processing and storage. Content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Drupal further simplify website creation and maintenance. Together, these technologies power the modern web, enabling dynamic and responsive digital experiences.</p>
